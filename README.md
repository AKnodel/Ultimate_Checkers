# Checkers Game with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a checkers game implemented in Python, featuring an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game also allows the user to choose the difficulty level, select from multiple themes, and choose to play against either a human or AI opponent.

## Getting Started
To run the game, you can either execute the `main.py` file or click on `Ultimate_Checkers.exe`.
